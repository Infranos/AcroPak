# AcroPak
Primarily for SDSU's Cyber Defense Team, but will likely serve a broader audience as time progresses/I add more.

Project:                        AR (Acronym Resolver)

Designer:                       Alexander Kirk

Build Model:                    0.0.0 Pre-Alpha Prototype

Reasoning for Build:            Often, CDT members have run into acronyms pertaining to networking, systems, web design, etc.,
                                and simply cannot keep track of it all.  That's where this package comes in!  :D

Installation Instructions:      To install this package, copy and unzip the AcroPak folder onto your Unix/Linux/Mac system.
                                In a terminal, enter the AcroPak directory, and execute:
                                        chmod 700 installer.sh
                                        ./installer.sh

Operating Instructions:         You may use either acro or nym to run the program once it is installed.
