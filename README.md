Project:			AR (Acronym Resolver)

Designer:			Alexander Kirk

Build Model:			0.0.0 Pre-Alpha Prototype

Reasoning for Build:		Often, CDT members run into acronyms pertaining to networking, systems, cybersec, etc., 
				and simply cannot keep track of it all.  That's where this package comes in!

Installation Instructions:	To install this package, copy and unzip the AcroPak folder onto your Unix/Linux/Mac system.
				In a terminal, enter the AcroPak directory, and execute:
					chmod 700 installer.sh
					./installer.sh
				
				If the installation fails, but the folders and files are there, you may need to install
				the locate utility.

Operating Instructions:		You may use either acro or nym to run the program once it is installed.
				Have fun!
